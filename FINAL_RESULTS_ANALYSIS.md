## üéØ Key Findings

### 1. **Llama-3.2-3B is the Clear Winner** ‚≠ê

**Strengths:**
- Highest accuracy among LLMs (54.2%)
- Best F1 score (59.7%)
- Best balance (3.4% gap between recall and specificity)
- Highest recall (55.6%) - catches more cases

**Why it wins:**
- Excellent balance: Recall 55.6% vs Specificity 52.2% (only 3.4% difference)
- Good at both sensitivity and specificity
- Small model (3B) but best performance

### 2. **Random Forest Still Best Overall**

**Random Forest: 57.6% accuracy, 63.8% F1**
- Beats all LLMs
- Better for structured tabular data
- Faster training (minutes vs hours)
- Lower computational cost

**But:** Llama-3.2-3B is close (54.2% vs 57.6%)!

### 3. **Larger ‚â† Better**

Surprising finding:
- Llama-3.2-3B (3B) > Llama-3.1-8B (8B)
- 54.2% accuracy vs 47.5% accuracy

**Possible reasons:**
- 8B model may need different hyperparameters
- Smaller models less prone to overfitting on small dataset
- 3B model better suited for this task complexity

### 4. **Improvement Over Previous Attempt**

**Previous (failed models):**
- Qwen3-4B: 42.4% ‚Üí Now Qwen2.5-7B: 44.1% (marginal improvement)
- Gemma-3-4B: 42.4% ‚Üí Now Phi-3-mini: 50.8% (‚úÖ **+8.4% improvement!**)
- DeepSeek-R1: 0% ‚Üí Now Llama-3.1-8B: 47.5% (‚úÖ **massive improvement!**)

## üí° Training Insights

### What the Data Shows:

#### 1. **Baseline Performance Reveals Issues**

**Models with bad baselines improved most:**
- Llama-3.2-3B: 38.9% ‚Üí 54.2% (+15.3%)
- Llama-3.1-8B: 38.9% ‚Üí 47.5% (+8.6%)
- Qwen2.5-7B: 35.6% ‚Üí 44.1% (+8.5%)

**Models with better baselines showed less improvement:**
- Mistral-7B: 52.5% ‚Üí 52.5% (0%)
- Phi-3-mini: 45.8% ‚Üí 50.8% (+5%)

**Insight:** Models that start completely biased (0% recall) benefit most from fine-tuning.

#### 2. **Learning Rate May Be Too Conservative**

Current learning rates:
- 3-4B models: 9e-7 to 1e-6
- 7-8B models: 8e-7

**Evidence for higher LR:**
- Llama-3.2-3B (9e-7) worked well
- Phi-3-mini (1e-6) worked moderately
- Larger models (8e-7) underperformed

**Recommendation:** Try 2-5x higher learning rates for 7-8B models

#### 3. **600 Iterations May Be Insufficient**

**Evidence:**
- No model reached Random Forest performance (57.6%)
- Some models (Qwen, Llama-3.1) still have very low recall
- Training likely stopped before convergence

**Recommendation:** Try 1000-1200 iterations for underperforming models

#### 4. **LoRA Rank 8 May Be Too Low**

**Evidence:**
- Llama-3.2-3B (rank 8) worked well for 3B model
- Larger 7-8B models underperformed
- May need higher capacity for larger models

**Recommendation:** Try rank 16 or 32 for 7-8B models
