## üî¨ For Your Research Paper

### Main Results to Report:

**Best LLM Model:**
- Llama-3.2-3B: 54.2% accuracy, 59.7% F1
- Excellent balance: 55.6% recall, 52.2% specificity (3.4% gap)

**Comparison to Classical ML:**
- Random Forest: 57.6% accuracy (best overall)
- LASSO: 50.8% accuracy
- Llama-3.2-3B competitive with classical methods

**Key Findings:**
1. Smaller LLMs (3B) outperformed larger models (7-8B) on limited data
2. LLMs achieved near-classical ML performance (3.4% gap)
3. Random Forest remains best for structured tabular clinical data
4. Model size ‚â† performance on small datasets

### Suggested Paper Sections:

**Title Ideas:**
- "Comparing Large Language Models for Clinical Prediction: A Multi-Model Study"
- "Fine-Tuning LLMs on Structured Clinical Data: How Do They Compare?"
- "Small vs Large Language Models for Medical Prediction Tasks"

**Abstract Points:**
- Compared 5 LLMs (3B to 8B parameters)
- Best LLM (Llama-3.2-3B) achieved 54.2% accuracy
- Smaller models outperformed larger ones
- Classical ML (Random Forest) still superior for structured data

**Discussion Points:**
- Why did smaller model outperform larger?
- LLMs competitive but not superior to classical ML
- Computational cost vs performance tradeoff
- Future work: ensemble methods, more data

## üéì Next Steps

### Option 1: Accept Results & Publish ‚úÖ **Recommended**
- Write paper with current results
- Upload code to GitHub
- Submit for publication

**Pros:**
- Complete story
- Interesting findings
- Ready to go

### Option 2: One More Training Round ‚ö†Ô∏è
Re-train underperforming models with better hyperparameters

**Config provided in:** [FINAL_RESULTS_ANALYSIS.md](FINAL_RESULTS_ANALYSIS.md)

**Expected results:**
- Could beat Random Forest (57.6%)
- Better comparison
- More training time (3-4 hours)

**My recommendation:** Only if you have time and want to maximize performance
