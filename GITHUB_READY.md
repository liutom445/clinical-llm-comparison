- ✅ **.gitignore** - Protects sensitive data
- ✅ **LICENSE** - MIT License
- ✅ **GITHUB_UPLOAD_GUIDE.md** - Complete upload instructions

### Privacy Protection
Your `.gitignore` ensures:
- ❌ **No clinical data** uploaded (`Trial 9/trial9.csv` excluded)
- ❌ **No model weights** uploaded (`finetuned-*/` excluded)
- ❌ **No logs** uploaded (`*.log` excluded)
- ✅ **Only code & docs** will be public

## 🚀 Upload in 3 Steps

### Step 1: Customize (2 minutes)
```bash
# Edit README.md and replace:
# - "Your Name" with your actual name
# - "your.email@example.com" with your email
# - "yourusername" with your GitHub username

nano README.md  # or use your preferred editor
```

### Step 2: Organize (1 minute)
```bash
bash prepare_for_github.sh
```

### Step 3: Upload (2 minutes)
```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: Multi-model LLM clinical prediction"

# Create repo on GitHub.com, then:
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/clinical-llm-comparison.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

**Total time: ~5 minutes!**

## 📧 Sharing Your Work

After upload, share:
- LinkedIn post about your project
- Twitter/X thread with results
- Email to collaborators
- Include in paper supplementary materials
- Add to CV under "Code Repositories"

**Example LinkedIn post:**
```
🚀 Just published my multi-model LLM comparison for clinical
prediction! Compared 5 models (Llama, Mistral, Phi, etc.) on
Apple Silicon. Interesting finding: Random Forest still beats
LLMs for structured clinical data!
