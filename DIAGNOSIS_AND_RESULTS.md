# Diagnosis & Fixed Results

## üîç What Went Wrong

Your models had **chat template / output format issues**, NOT training failures:

### Problem 1: Qwen3-4B (Was 0%, Now 42.4%)
- **Issue:** Outputting `<think></think>` tags before answer
- **Example:** `"<think>\n\n</think>\n\nNo"`
- **Fix:** Strip thinking tags before parsing
- **Result:** ‚úÖ Now working (100% parsed)

### Problem 2: DeepSeek-R1 (Was 0%, Now 39% but biased)
- **Issue:** Reasoning model outputs full thought process
- **Example:** `"Okay, so I need to figure out whether this patient..."`
- **Fix:** Look for answer patterns in longer text
- **Result:** ‚ö†Ô∏è Parsing works (98.3%) but model learned to always say "No"

### Problem 3: Gemma-3-4B-QAT (Was 42.4%, Still 42.4%)
- **Issue:** Same metrics = same problem (was already partially working)
- **Result:** ‚úÖ Now reliably parsing (100%)

## üéØ Conclusions & Recommendations

### Main Finding:
**Only 2 out of 5 models achieved acceptable performance** (>50% accuracy)

### Best Models:
1. **Mistral-7B** - Best for overall accuracy
2. **Llama-3.2-3B** - Best for balanced predictions

### Why Some Models Failed:

#### Qwen3-4B & Gemma-3-4B-QAT:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Undertrained** or wrong hyperparameters
- **Solutions to try:**
  - Increase iterations: 600 ‚Üí 1000
  - Increase learning rate: 1e-6 ‚Üí 5e-6
  - Increase LoRA rank: 8 ‚Üí 16
  - Check if balanced sampling worked correctly

#### DeepSeek-R1:
- ‚ùå **Wrong model type** for this task
- **Reasons:**
  - R1 models are designed for complex reasoning, not simple classification
  - The "thinking" process may interfere with direct Yes/No answers
  - May need special prompting (e.g., "Think step by step, then answer Yes or No")

## üîß What You Should Do Next

### Option 1: Accept Current Results (Fastest)
Use **Llama-3.2-3B** and **Mistral-7B** for your paper:
- Both are working well
- Good for comparison
- Can discuss why others failed as part of analysis

### Option 2: Re-train Failed Models (Recommended)
Re-train with better hyperparameters:

```json
// For Qwen3-4B
{
  "learning_rate": 5e-6,  // Was 1e-6
  "num_iters": 1000,      // Was 600
  "lora_rank": 16         // Was 8
}

// For Gemma-3-4B-QAT
{
  "learning_rate": 5e-6,  // Was 9e-7
  "num_iters": 1000,      // Was 600
  "lora_rank": 16         // Was 8
}
```

### Option 3: Try New Models (Alternative)
Replace failed models with proven alternatives:
- Replace DeepSeek-R1 with: `Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct-4bit`
- Replace Qwen3 with: `Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct-4bit`

## üìä Comparison to Baselines

Your classical ML baselines (from Qwen3 results file):
- **LASSO:** 50.8% accuracy, 52.5% F1
- **Random Forest:** 57.6% accuracy, 63.8% F1

### LLM vs Classical ML:
- **Mistral-7B:** Comparable to LASSO, slightly worse than RF
- **Llama-3.2-3B:** Comparable to LASSO, worse than RF
- **Others:** Worse than both classical methods

**Conclusion:** For this specific task, **Random Forest** is actually the best performer!

## üí° Key Insights

### 1. Chat Template Matters
- Different models have different output formats
- Qwen3 uses `<think>` tags
- DeepSeek-R1 outputs reasoning process
- Need robust parsing for multi-model comparison

### 2. Not All Models Are Equal
- Larger ‚â† Better (7B DeepSeek failed, 3B Llama succeeded)
- QAT quantization didn't help Gemma
- Model architecture matters more than size

### 3. Task-Model Fit Important
- DeepSeek-R1 is a reasoning model, not for simple classification
- Some models better suited for complex tasks, not binary decisions

### 4. Classical ML Still Competitive
- Random Forest (57.6%) beats all LLMs
- LASSO (50.8%) matches best LLMs
- For small structured datasets, tree-based methods may be better

## üéØ Final Recommendation

**For your paper/presentation:**

### Best LLM Models (Use These):
1. **Mistral-7B** (52.5% accuracy)
2. **Llama-3.2-3B** (50.8% accuracy, best balance)

### Best Overall:
**Random Forest** (57.6% accuracy, 63.8% F1)

### Interesting Discussion Points:
- Why did larger DeepSeek fail while smaller Llama succeeded?
- Why did QAT Gemma underperform?
- Why does Random Forest beat all LLMs for this task?
- What role does model architecture play vs size?
